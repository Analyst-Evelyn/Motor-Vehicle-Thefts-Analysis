# Motor-Vehicle-Thefts-Analysis 
##  Project Overview
This project analyzes stolen vehicle data using MySQL and Power BI to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. The analysis explores vehicle characteristics, regional variations, and potential factors influencing theft rates.

**Problem Statement**

Motor vehicle theft remains a persistent issue in New Zealand, affecting not only individuals, but also insurance companies and law enforcement agencies. Understanding the patterns and trends associated with stolen vehicles is crucial for developing preventive measures and improving recovery efforts.T his project aims to uncover patterns in stolen vehicle data, analyze regional theft trends, and identify the most and least targeted vehicle types. By leveraging MySQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, I hope to generate actionable insights that help authorities and vehicle owners mitigate theft risks.  

**Project Objectives**
1.  Identify trends in stolen vehicle data â€“ Analyze the most stolen vehicle types, colors, and model years.  

2.  Determine regional variations in theft â€“ Understand how theft rates vary by location, population, and density.  

3.  Assess the age of stolen vehicles â€“ Investigate whether newer or older models are more frequently stolen.  

4.  Provide data-driven recommendations â€“ Suggest strategies for reducing vehicle theft based on key findings.

     
##ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description  

The dataset consists of multiple tables, including:

stolen_vehicles â€“ Details of stolen vehicles (type, model year, color, date stolen).  

locations â€“ Region, country, population, and density details.  

make_details -  Detail description on the make of the various vehicles (make_id, make_name, make_type)   

## Data Source.  

This dataset was downloaded from Maven Analytics Playground [https://app.mavenanalytics.io/datasets]

   ## Recommendation
   
   1. Enhancing Vehicle Security:

     Vehicle owners should install GPS trackers and immobilizers to reduce  theft risk.

     Older vehicle models should be upgraded with modern security features.

2. Regional Policy Changes:

     Law enforcement agencies should increase patrols in high-theft regions.

     Implementation of public vehicle registration databases to track stolen vehicles.

3. Awareness & Prevention Measures:

     Campaigns to educate vehicle owners on high-risk areas and security best practices.

     Car dealerships should recommend security upgrades to buyers.
